# Mood Notes Overview

**Mood Notes** is a simple web application that allows users to explore different moods and get motivational affirmations based on themes. Users can click on a mood theme button to receive a random affirmation, helping promote positivity and mindfulness.  

The purpose of creating this software was to practice **TypeScript**, **asynchronous programming**, **recursion**, **classes**, **error handling**, and **API integration** in a small, manageable project. This project also serves as a portfolio piece demonstrating these skills.
